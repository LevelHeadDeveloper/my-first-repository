# What is this?

For those of you looking at this after seeing my other repositories, don't worry, this is completely unrelated to my other project(s). It's for a project for school.

# But what is it?

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    * This is a small program that takes in a text file (placed in the program directory, titled "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt"). It then counts how many times each line is used, and allows you to select a number of ways to view that information. In the context of the project, it is used to aggregate data from a stocklist.
* What did you do particularly well?
    * Modularization! The program comes in two parts: one keeps track of the data and provides interfaces to access and modify it under certain conditions, and the other one handles the program's main loop.
* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    * As I write this README, I realize I forgot to add any form of error handling to the actual opening of the file. So for those of you who want to try this out, MAKE SURE you have a file titled "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt".
* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    * My least favorite part of any project is output formatting. My go-to resource for all things C++ is cppreference.com.
* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    * Code optimization, modularization, and referencing documentation.
* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    * Say it with me folks! Modularization! Instead of making one large behemoth, I wrote the program in two parts! (Given how small it is, I didn't think it needed more than two.)
